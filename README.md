Here is a Hokito game in python.
You can play alone with 2 bots : easy (working) and medium (not working for now) or you can play with a friend or your self (idk why but you know XD)
Rules are simple : There are 3 pawns : 1 point (the one with 1 shape), 2 points (with 2 shapes) and 3 points (the other). The pawn move horizontally or vertically (not diagonal) and 1 point = 1 box, 2 points = 2 boxes etc...

When you select a pawn, there will be circles. Green is the pawn you selected and red is where you can move it. And blue circles are bot moves
Important : you jump over empty boxes !
When you move your pawn on an other one (it doesn't matter if it's one of yours or the ennemy), you don't "eat" the pawn. Just make a tower called "pile" with this one (or theses ones). A pile can only go on an other and a pawn can only go on a pawn.
To count points : take the points of a pawn, and multiply this with the number in top left of the pawn. Do this with all your pawns. (simple)

How to play : download all the .py files and the .png and execute Main.py (easy)

Good luck !
